[![Check all solutions](https://github.com/shpikat/advent-of-code-2025/actions/workflows/check-solutions.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/shpikat/advent-of-code-2025/actions/workflows/check-solutions.yml)

The solutions are organized by days. As long as both parts are usually related,
they share one Python file: `solution.py`.
The sample test cases and the actual puzzle answer can be found in `test_solution.py` test file.

All the tests can be run with one command. Each test has its own execution time stopwatch.

```shell
python -m unittest -v
```
